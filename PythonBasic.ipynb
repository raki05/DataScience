What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","  - Python is an interpretor based high level programming language.It's popular\n","    beacuse it's easy to learn and beginner programmers friendly.It's also offer various in built libarary which save devloper's time to write boiler plate code.Besides,it's widely used in variety of domain like datascience, web devlopment and devops.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  - Interpreter in pyhthon execute code line by line at run time without\n","    compiling and converting it in to a byte code.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - Keywords are reserved word in python that has special meaning and\n","    functionalities ex: print,type,if, else ,for , while etc. Keyword should not be used to defined any identites like variable,class or methods.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - Though you can defined a variable name with keyword but than keyword will\n","    loose it's functionality. Hence we shouldn't use keyword as variable name.\n","    Ex: if i defined a variable print = 5 i will not get any syntax error but while i try to print \"print\" variable it will throw runtime error.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n"," - Mutability means modifiable/changable once an object is created. In python\n","   there are certain data type which are mutable like list,dictonary and sets. You can perform insert,add and remove operation in above datatype after their creation.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n"," - Lists are mutable as once list are created we can change it's state by\n","   adding,removing and replacing an element, where as tuple also contain list of element but we can't change the state of tupple once its created.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n"," - In python \"==\" is used to compare the variabble values stoed in heap memory\n","   where as \"is\"operator is used to compare reference variable memory location which they are pointed to.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n"," - Logical operator in python are used to join conditional statement, meaning\n","   if we want to check 2 conditionas together we can use logical operators like\n","   and,or and not.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n"," - Typecasting is used to convert one data type to another data type using\n","   built in keywords/function.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  -  Implicit typecasting is conversion where python intutively do data\n","     conversion without user intervention ex: i have 2 variables a = 5 and b =10.5 and if we want to add these 2 variables and print the sum ,first python\n","     will promote int variable a to float and then add float variable to b .So that the resultant sum will be a float and we will not loose the fraction part.\n","     Explicit type casting is when a user manually converts one data type to another. For example, when we take input from a user using the input() function, it always returns a string. So, if we want to take the user's age as input, it will initially be a string. To store it as an integer, we need to manually typecast the input using int(). ex: name = int(input(\"entery your name: \")).\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  - Conditional statement in python is used to control the flow of exection\n","    based on certain condtions are met or not. They are used for decision making and they are boolean.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","  - elif statement is used to check multi condtional statement and it is used\n","    between if and else statement to check additional conditon. ex: if first condtion is false elif will check next condtion is true or false and eventually in else we can pass some default statement.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  - For loops are used if we already know the number of iteration in advance\n","    and it will keep running until no of iterations are completed.\n","    where as while loop iterate until certain condtion is true , it doesn't require no. of itertions in advance.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","    While loops can be used where no. of iterations are not known in advance. A\n","    typical scenario can be we want to prompt a user until certain conditons are not met , let's say asking user to provide valid email and run it in infinite loop until user enter valid email address and once valid email is entered we can break the loop.\n","    Ex:\n","      email = input(\"enter your email address: \")\n","      while True:\n","         if \"@\" not in email:\n","            print(\"please enter a valid email,@ is must in email\")\n","            break\n","        else:\n","           print(\"thank you for submitting valid email\")\n","           break\n","

Exception handling ensures that any unwanted event doesnt interrupt the flow of execution and it's been handled properly so that a program can execute successfully.\n","\n","**3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n","  The code writtend under finally block will always execute whether there is exception or not. It's useful when we would like to close any open network or database connection, such closer we alway do under finally block.\n","\n","**4.What is logging in Python?**\n","  Logging is a way of tracking and recording flow of execution of program. It is used for monitoring , debugging and troubleshooting puprose.\n","\n","**5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n","  __del__ method in python is a dunder method which is always called when an object is about to be destroyed. They are used during garbage colleciton.\n","\n","**6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n","   Import is used when we are directly importing a module within our code whereas from... import are used when we try to import something from libarary or a package.\n","\n","**7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n","  We can handle multiple exception in python by using multiple except block or using , seperated exceptions list using single except block. If we have multiple exception we can directly give generic exception under single except block and hadle it through that as well.\n","\n","**8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n","  When we use 'with' statement to handle file esentially we dont have to bother about closing the file once read or write operation is done.\n","\n","**9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n"," Multitheading is running multiple thread of a program concurrently in single processor.\n"," Multiprocessing is running application under multiple processors parallely.\n"," Multithreading is good for I/O bound program where as Multiprocessing is used for CPU oriented applicaitons.\n","\n","**10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n","   Logging is a way of tracking and recording flow of execution of program. It is used for monitoring , debugging and troubleshooting puprose.\n","\n","**11.What is memory management in Python?**\n","   Memory Managment in python is automatic process where python takes care of memory management using private heap,reference counter and garbage collection.As an developer we should write memomry efficient program with proper time and space complexity so that memory management can be done faster and effective manner by pyton.\n","\n","**12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n","   We should write the buggy/suspected code under try block and handle any potential exception under except block. Optionally we can also use finally and else blocks for keeping codes which require explicity closure statement and codes which require happy paths to be put under seperate block respectively.\n","\n","**13.Why is memory management important in Python?**\n","  Memory management in python is important because it impact performance, stablility and scalability of program.\n","\n","**14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n","  We write code that may raise exception under try block. Under except block we handle exception raised under try block for successful execution of program without and disruption.\n","\n","**15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n","  Garbage collection automatically reclaim the memory used by objects that are no longer in use. In some scenario you can invoke garbage collection in your code to enforce garbage collection manually.\n","\n","**16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n","  The else block in python exception handling is used when you have a code that should only run if there is no exception recoreded in try block.\n","\n","**17.What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n","  There are 5 common logging levals in python they are DEBUG,INFO,TRACE,ERROR and CRITICAl. You can set the logging level using baseconfig in python.\n","\n","**18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n","  os.fork() or multiprocessing modeule both create new processes in python but they differ in interoperability as os.fork() can only work on linux/unix platform whereas multiprocessing moudule had wide coverage and it's crossplatform supported.There use cases are also different os.fork() is used for low level programming like system level process control whre as multiprocessing is used on high level applicaitons like python programs to create parallelism.\n","\n","**19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n","  When you close a file it ensures that system resources are released and data is saved. When we run close function it ensures that buffer is flushed and data is saved at the disk.\n","\n","**20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n","  file.read() read entire files into a single string whereas file.readline() just read single line of a file till we reach /n.\n","\n","**21.What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n","  Logging module is used for tracking events while programe is running. It's python built in way to handle debugging,monitoring and auditing wihtout using print statement.\n","\n","**22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n","  Python uses 'open' and 'with open' module for file handling.\n","\n","**23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n","  Though python handle memory management automatically but the way we write the code pose severall challanges during memory management like Memory Leaks,Circular Reference, High Memory usage and Garbage collection overhead.\n","\n","**24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n","  We can create a custom class for exception handling which implement Exception class. By using this we can pass custom exception manually at run time. We can also raise manual exception using built in function raise.\n","\n","**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n","   It is important to use multihtreading in certain applications because it will make program faster and responsive without using multiple process. If we have I/O bound applicaiton we can use multipthreading to create multiple thread of a program which can run concurrently within a single process to make program execution faster.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ta18-rlQ3zme"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''1.How can you open a file for writing in Python and write a string to it.'''\n","\n","file =  open(\"demo.txt\", \"w\")\n","file.write(\"Hello World\")\n","file.close()"],"metadata":{"id":"nCii4eclF-y7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755083056926,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"rakesh kumar","userId":"00511206985775184146"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6bfhn4Kv3vjM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755083444589,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"rakesh kumar","userId":"00511206985775184146"}},"outputId":"a259f516-5d68-49e1-ac72-c7755dfa0820"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["This directory includes a few sample datasets to get you started.\n","\n","*   `california_housing_data*.csv` is California housing data from the 1990 US\n","    Census; more information is available at:\n","    https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRhYtsvc5eOR2FWNCwaBiKL6suIOrxJig8LcSBbmCbyYsayia_DvPOOBlXZ4CAlQ5nlDD8kTaIDRwrN/pub\n","\n","*   `mnist_*.csv` is a small sample of the\n","    [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), which is\n","    described at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\n","\n","*   `anscombe.json` contains a copy of\n","    [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet); it\n","    was originally described in\n","\n","    Anscombe, F.

It basically offers 2 things:\n","    data-> variable that belongs to the object\n","    behavior-> function that applies on the data.\n","\n","**3.What is an object in OOP?**\n","  Object in oop is instance of a class.It's a real usable things created from class blueprint.\n","\n","**4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n","  Abstraction is hiding internal implementation and only exposing esential feature to the outside world.\n","  Encapsulation is binding internal data and method to a signle class and restricting access to some data by making it private.\n","\n","**5.What are dunder methods in Python?**\n","  Dunder method in python are inbuild class method.These are special method whose name starts and edns with two underscore. They are also known as special or magic methods. Ex: __add__ ,__str__\n","\n","**6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n","  Inheritance is an oops concept where a class can extend proprty and method of another class and by doing so it inherits all it's data and behaviour. Inheritance creates code reusability and avoid duplications.\n","\n","**7.What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n","  Ability of differenct classes to call same methods in different ways is call polymorphism. The same method can call or behave differently depending on the object which is calling it.\n","\n","**8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n","  Encapsulation is achieved by making data and method as private within a class. You can make data and method as private by putting 2 underscores at start of variable name or method.\n","\n","**9.What is a constructor in Python?**\n","  Constructor in python are used to initialize a class or create an object. It also assign memory to an object.\n","\n","**10.What are class and static methods in Python?**\n","  Class methods are bound to the class and not object.It recieves class itself as an argument. Class method are used to access and modify class variable.\n","  Static methods are assigned to class but doesn't take class or instance as argument. Static method doesn't modify class variabls.\n","\n","**11.What is method overloading in Python?**\n","  Method overloading is having same method name but accept different paramters within a class. Python doesn't support method overloading typically as it will always load latest method defined within class while creating an instance or throw error.\n","\n","**12.What is method overriding in OOP?**\n","  Method overriding is when child class provides different implementation for a method which is also present in parent class.\n","\n","**13.What is a property decorator in Python?**\n","  The @property decorator in python are used to make a method behave like and attribute.\n","\n","**14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n","  Polymorphism in python make code resusable, flexible and easier to maintain by allowing the same method to be called by different type of object.\n","\n","**15.What is an abstract class in Python?**\n","  Abstract class in pthon are classes which can't be instantitated and act as a blueprint for other classes. An abstract class should have atleast one abstract method which would be implemented by it's child class.\n","\n","**16.What are the advantages of OOP?**\n","  OOP make code reusable,flexible and easier to maintain by offering charectristics like inheritance,polymorphism,encapsulation and abstratction.\n","\n","**17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n","  Class variable are defined at class level outside of any method it belongs to the class and shared by all instances of class.\n","  Instance variable belongs to an object and diffiend inside a method , each object gets it's own copy of instance variable.\n","\n","**18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n","  Multiple inheritence in python is when a child class inherrit from multiple parents.\n","    ex: class Father:\n","           pass\n","        class Mother:\n","            pass\n","        class Child(Father,Mother):\n","            pass\n","**19.Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\"  methods in Python?**\n","  __str__ and __repr__ are dundor methods they are used to return user friendly or devloper friendly message respectively.__str__ are used for readiblity presepectiv for end users. Whereas __repr__ is used by devloper in case of debugging.\n","\n","**20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?**\n","  super() function in python is used to call a method from paternt calss by child class withoud specifically using class name.\n","\n","**21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n","  The __del__ method in python is a dunder or special method that is called when object is about to being destroyed. It is used in garbage collection.\n","\n","**22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n","  StaticMethod is assigned to a class but doesn't take cls or instance as an argument. It can't modify class variables.\n","  ClassMethod belongs to class it takes cls as an argument and are used to modify class variabl.\n","\n","**23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n","  Polymorphism in python works with inheritance by allowing same method name under different child class of a parent class and at runtime it decide which version of method implementation will be called.\n","\n","**24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n","  Method chaining in python is a concept where you call different methods of same object in a single line , as each method of an object returns 'self' object, using which you will call another method.\n","\n","**25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?**\n","  __call__ is dunder or magic method in python which makes an object callable entities.\n","  Ex: class Greet:\n","          def __init__(self,greeting):\n","                self.greeting = greeting\n","          def __call__(self,name):\n","              self.name = name\n","              return f\"{self.greeting}, {self.name}\"\n","      greet = Greet(\"Hello\")\n","      print(greet(\"rakesh\"))\n","      print(greet(\"ramesh\"))"],"metadata":{"id":"tADS2AoUQtc3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''1.
